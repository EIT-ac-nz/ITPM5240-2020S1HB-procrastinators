      <h4 class="head">Our Product</h4>
      <p class="text">We over the course of 14 entire days, have developed a new breed of operating system, one based on security and user
	     control, We reveal to you:</p>
	      
      <h5 class="head-center">ProcrastOS</h5>
      	<img src="https://www.cwenterprises.co.uk/app/uploads/2017/06/vm-220343-e1497537320901-768x507.jpg" class="image-center">
      	<p class="text-center">ProcrastOS is the premier operating system for securty, pen-testing, or any privacy concious user. </p>
	      
      <hr>
      <h5 class="head">Why Choose ProcrastOS?</h5>
      <ul>
		<li class="text">Securtiy</il>
	        <p class="text">The security features of ProcrastOS are second to none, all incoming and outcoming data is run through
		onion layered encryption nodes, creating an enviroment with no single point of failure leading to far safer use, albiet at
	      	a somewhat slower pace.</p>
	      
	        <li class="text">Privacy</il>
	        <p class="text">Our use of onion technology also prevents data breaches as even we have no knowledge of the data being
	    	transfered between systems, but on top of that we have also implemented a built in Virtual Private Network that
	    	is available for use.</p>
	    
	        <li class="text">Freedom</il>
	        <p class="text">We create no restrictions for you in ProcrastOS, everything is open-source if you can code it you can
		do it, ProcrastOS is primarily based on debian linux for ease of use, but we have also implemented support for not just
		debian shell but also unbuntu, windows powershell/bash, and even Mac OSX terminal.</p>
	
		<li class="text">Pen-Testing</il>
	        <p class="text">While the typical end-user might not be interested in Pen-Testing we thought it a good idea to include 20
		of the most common Pen-Testing programs such as: 'Aircrack-ng', 'WPScan', and 'Nmap'.</p>

	</ul>
	<br>
	<p class="text">And as you can see from the diagram below our system architecture uses a 'Protection-Ring' for system privileges,
		meaning that software and code can only penetrate the higher levels thus protecting the invaluable system functions that
		exist within the lower levels, and with ProcrastOS any added programs or code that attempts to access the lower levels, must
		be manually approved by the user, this creates even more protection against malicous software or programs.

	<p class="head">Our Competitors</p>

	<p class="text">Windows is this most popular Operating System on the planet, and because of this Windows is constantly the target
	of malicious software attacks due to this PracrastOS offers an alternative that is not only more secure in its technicaly aspects but
	also because, of PrcrastOS's low profile we can slip under the rader simply because we have less user's.</p>

	<p class="text">While windows does offer more freedom than it's competitor; Apple, this is still highly limited to improve the normal
	end-user's experience.</p>
	<br>
	
	<p class="text">Mac is the complete oposate of what we are trying to achieve here at ProcrastOS, while that is fine again for the normal
	end-user, we offer a far deeper experience of freedom and privacy than apple can offer with macOS.</p>
	<br>
	
	<p class="text">Linux offers a large amount of freedom and should be commended however linux is an open-source operating systemthis
	can create issues with being far more susceptive to malware, however this is usually mitigated by the fact that compared to Windows
	and Mac Linux is far less popular.</p>
